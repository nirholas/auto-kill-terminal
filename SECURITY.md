# Security Policy

## Overview

This project contains Markdown instruction files and a Bash install script. There is no runtime code, no dependencies, and no package to install. The attack surface is minimal.

## Install Script

The `install.sh` script modifies agent instruction files in your repository. Before running it:

1. Review the script contents
2. Use `--dry-run` to preview changes
3. Verify the changes after running

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue (e.g., in the install script), please report it by opening a GitHub issue or emailing the maintainer directly.
