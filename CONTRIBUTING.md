# Contributing to auto-kill-terminal

Thanks for wanting to help! This project exists because zombie terminals are a universal pain point for anyone using AI agents in VS Code. Every contribution helps.

## Ways to Contribute

### Report a New Agent

Tested these rules with an agent not in the [compatibility table](README.md#supported-agents)? Open a PR updating the table with your results.

### Add a Template

If you use an AI tool that has its own instruction file format, add a template to `templates/` following the existing pattern.

### Improve the Rules

Found a phrasing that works better with a specific agent? Open an issue or PR. We care about what actually works, not what sounds good.

### Spread the Word

Star the repo ⭐, share it with your team, or mention it when someone complains about zombie terminals in their Codespace.

1. Fork the repo
